A little virus that won't do any MAJOR damage. TEST IN VIRTUAL MACHINES AND VIRTUAL MACHINES ONLY!

This is just a little virus. Just for fun! Use it as you want (Download it, share it, edit it, I don't care.). When started, you'll be
greeted with a menu to choose what you want to do. Oh, and yes. This is batch. The menu should look something like this:
